Welcome humans. My name is Ghost Bot 5000, and I am the latest in anti-ghost technology. I will help you survive.
 You have all been equipped with ghost detectors, that vibrate when ghosts are near. 
 As you might have noticed, there is one circling you right now. . 
 Make sure to communicate with each other to keep track of it. . 
 Sometimes the ghost will attack, and that sounds like this. 
 
 
 
When the ghost attacks, only one of you will be able to defend us all.  The one closest to the ghost must take care of it,
 otherwise the defence system will not be powerful enough, so make sure that you feel the ghost 
 before you press the button to activate the defence system. 
 
 I think there is a ghost closing in. Lets see if you can stop it. Get ready, and dont forget to communicate with each other.
 
"Sometimes the ghost attacks, but my radar can pick it up. Listen for this sound. "
